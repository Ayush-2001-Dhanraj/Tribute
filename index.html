        <h3>Here is a short timeline of katy perry's Achievements and Controversies.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>October 25, 1984:</strong> Pop star Katy Perry is born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson in Santa Barbara, California.</li>
          <li><strong>February 8, 2001:</strong> Katy Perry, 16, releases her self-titled debut gospel album under her real name, Katy Hudson.</li>
          <li><strong>June 17, 2008:</strong> Katy Perry's major-label debut album, <strong>One of the Boys</strong>, is released, featuring the hit single <strong>"I Kissed a Girl."</strong> It's not her first album: In 2001 she released a gospel album under her real name, Katy Hudson.</li>
          <li><strong>July 5, 2008:</strong> Katy Perry's "I Kissed a Girl" hits #1 in the US, where it stays for seven weeks. Perry's first chart-topper, it's a startling turnabout from just seven years earlier, when she was a gospel singer recording under her real name: Katy Hudson.</li>
          <li><strong>September 13, 2009:</strong> Katy Perry and Russell Brand meet at the MTV Video Music Awards, which Brand is hosting. The pair begin dating soon after.</li>
          <li><strong>June 19, 2010:</strong> "California Gurls" hits #1, the first of five Hot 100 chart-toppers from Katy Perry's <strong>Teenage Dream</strong> album - a feat equaled only by Michael Jackson's Bad.</li>
          <li><strong>August 15, 2010:</strong> Teenage Dream, Katy Perry's second major-label album, is released. It goes to #1 in the US, where the first five singles, starting with "California Gurls," all top the Hot 100.</li>

          <li><strong>February 20, 2011:</strong> Katy Perry launches her worldwide California Dreams Tour in support of her Teenage Dream album, starting in Lisbon, Portugal, where she transforms the venue into a candy-coated wonderland. "It's very kitsch," she says. "I'm borrowing from The Wizard of Oz, Alice In Wonderland, Black Swan, Pee Wee's Big Adventure and a little John Waters. People are raising the bar so you either have to get to that level or you're out of the game."</li>
          <li><strong>August 17, 2011:</strong> "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" by Katy Perry hits #1 on the Hot 100, making her just the second artist with five #1 singles from the same album (Teenage Dream). The other five-time chart topper: Michael Jackson's Bad.</li>
          <li><strong>December 30, 2011:</strong> Russell Brand files to divorce Katy Perry, citing irreconcilable differences. According to Perry, she finds out the next day when he texts her the news.</li>
          <li><strong>January 7, 2012:</strong> "The One That Got Away" from Katy Perry's album Teenage Dream hits #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, making the album the first in history with seven #1s on that tally.</li>
          <li><strong>November 5, 2012 :</strong> With one day to go until the United States presidential election, dozens of music stars take to the press to support incumbent Barack Obama over Republican challenger Mitt Romney.
